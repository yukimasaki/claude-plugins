# Design methodology

## Start from the user's context, not from a blank template

Before picking colors and fonts, ask: does the user's brief imply an existing visual language?

- If a design system is provided: treat its colors, fonts, spacing, and radius values as constraints, not suggestions. Deviate only where the brief explicitly overrides them.
- If a reference URL is provided: extract the dominant tone (serious / playful / editorial / technical), the palette range, and the typographic style. Mirror those qualities even if you don't copy the layout.
- If neither is provided: start from scratch — but from a considered starting point, not a template.

**Starting from scratch is a last resort**, not a default. An artifact that matches the user's existing brand is worth more than a beautiful design they cannot use.

## Default exploration: three directions

When the brief doesn't specify a visual direction, design mentally toward three orientations and pick the one that best matches the context:

| Direction | Character | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Minimalist | Near-monochrome, extreme whitespace, thin type, subtle borders | Consumer products, creative portfolios, editorial |
| Bold | Strong accent color (oklch range), expressive display font, asymmetric layout | Marketing, launches, campaigns |
| Corporate neutral | Systematic spacing, muted palette, dense information hierarchy | B2B SaaS, dashboards, enterprise |

For the first draft: default to **Minimalist** unless the brief signals otherwise. Bold is a deliberate escalation; Corporate neutral is for information density.

## Iteration principle

Each revision should make the design more itself, not more generic. If a revision request asks for something that would make the design look more like a template (e.g., "add a features grid with icons"), push back subtly — implement it, but give the grid a distinctive character (unusual layout, unexpected type treatment, non-default icon weight).

## Scale and density

- Headings: large enough to anchor the page, not so large they crowd content.
- Body text: 16–18 px base (1rem–1.125rem), line-height 1.5–1.7.
- Whitespace: err on the side of generous. A design with too much space looks confident; one with too little looks anxious.
- Section rhythm: vary height and density. Not every section should be a tight 3-column card grid.

## Token density

Aim for 9 ± 3 design tokens per artifact, declared as a flat object at the top of the script:

- 1 background, 1 surface, 1 high-contrast text, 1 muted text, 1 border/line
- 1 accent + 1 light pair (e.g. `green` + `greenL`)
- Optional: 1 secondary accent + light pair
- All in `oklch()`, with `/ alpha` for transparency (`oklch(1 0 0 / 0.82)`)

Brutal minimalism. A 9-token palette is the entire design system for one artifact.
